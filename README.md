# OM-SCREAMER

THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO PORT THE OM-BACKTRACK LIBRARY (CONSTRAINT SOLVER PROJECT FROM OLDER VERSIONS OF OPENMUSIC) TO OM 7.2.
THIS PROJECT ALSO AIMS TO EXPAND SCREAMER POSSIBILITIES WITH SCREAMER-PLUS (SEE https://github.com/danlentz/screamer-plus/blob/master/screamer-plus.lisp).
THE SCREAMER PACKAGE ITSELF WAS NOT INCLUDED HERE SINCE IT'S ALREADY AVAILABLE IN OM (FROM MATHTOOLS).
